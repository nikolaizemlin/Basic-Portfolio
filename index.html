            <p> I worked as a mechanic though highschool and for a few years after I gaduated. I opened up a mechanic 
            shop with my dad and worked with him for about 4 years.  I left and went into steel construction and worked
            on commercial building and hung drywall for about 4 years. I then went on to build a few houses in the valley
            and did some TI work in some commercial building. Took a month and helped build a log cabin in Utah. I got tired 
            of working out in the sun so I went and got a degree and started working at Shast Pools. Soon I was drawing all 
            the pools for Mesa, Tempe, Awetukee, Chandler, Gilbert, San Tan valley, Tucon and Florence. I recived a job 
            offer at Titan for detailing formwork drawings and took it. I have been with Titan for 14 years now and enjoy 
            working for this company.</p>
